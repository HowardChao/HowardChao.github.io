I am building a mathematical Markov chain model to simulate numbers of people infected after being vaccinated by trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV/QIV) and the cost-effectiveness with different vaccine coverage.
The main goal is to provide a powerful vaccine cost-effectiveness website for Taiwan Centers for Disease Control to assess public health policies.
The back-end of the website is written in Python Django and Django-Q task scheduler.
