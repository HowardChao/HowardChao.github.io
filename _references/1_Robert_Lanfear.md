I worked as a research assistant at professor <a target="_blank"  href="https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/robert-lanfear" style="color:#4A4F53">Robert Lanfear</a>'s <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.robertlanfear.com/" style="color:#4A4F53">Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics Lab</a> during my exchange at the Australian National University (September, 2019 - June, 2020). My first project is to rewrite an R package, sangeranalyseR, that Rob wrote few years ago. I changed the R package into object oriented version, added shiny applications, and uploaded it to Bioconductor. The second project that we tried is using machine learning to estimate phylogenetic trees from DNA sequence data.
