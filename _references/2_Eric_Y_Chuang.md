I started to do research at professor Eric Y. Chuang's Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Lab at National Taiwan University Centers of Genomic and Precision Medicine (CGM) since my second year of university (February, 2018). In the first few months, I learned basic bioinformatics data analysis technique for example quality control, short reads alignment, differential gene expression analysis and functional analysis etc.


Later on, I designed an R package, RNASeqR, that can analyze RNA-Seq data in only six steps and it is now on Bioconductor 3.10 release. This project is co-advised by professor Eric Y. Chuang and professor Tzu-Pin Lu. I presented RNASeqR at 2018 CGM summer research competition and won the first prize among all summer research students. I also oral presented this research in International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) 2019 in Columbus, USA and now it is published on IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.


The second projec that I am working on is TB-NGS web server. I started this project since January, 2019. The main purpose of it is to provide an user-friendly UI and a reliable pipeline to run <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> data analysis online.
