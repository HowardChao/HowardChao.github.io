I am working as an research assistant at professor <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/hktsai/index_en.html" style="color:#4A4F53">Huai-Kuang Tsai</a>'s <a target="_blank"  href="https://bits.iis.sinica.edu.tw/?id=1" style="color:#4A4F53">Bioinformatics Lab</a> since July, 2020. My main goal is to develop an elution profile-based protein complexes inference algorithm. The current methods calculate different scores based on entire protein elution profiles and the method that I am working on is to calculate local scores, which provide more in-depth information, for each fraction on elution profiles.
