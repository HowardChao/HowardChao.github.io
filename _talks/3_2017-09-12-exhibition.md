It is first helf in 1978 by WITSA (World information Technology & Services Alliance), and has become the premier international ICT forum. WCIT brings together over 2,500 visionaries, captions of industry, government leaders and academics from more than 80 countires.

2017 HackNTU is one of the biggest hackathon in Taiwan (451 people). Two friends of mine and I attended 2017 HackNTU and won the first prize among all transportation projects by "Smart Bus Bell" Android app which is designed to provide bus information in Taipei. Our team was invited to present this work with Taipei City Government in the World Congress on Information Technology 2017 (WCIT 2017). The exhibition topic was "Smart City transportation".
