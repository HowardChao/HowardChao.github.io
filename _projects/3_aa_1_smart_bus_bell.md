<div style="margin-left: 30px">
  <p>Two friends of mine and I attended <b>2017 HackNTU</b> and won the Elite Prize (1$^{st}$ prize) among all transportation projects by "Smart Bus Bell". During the hackathon, we proposed a novel bus bell idea and built two Android apps, user-end and driver-end apps, to provide real-time bus information in Taipei. In the three-person team, I was responsible for developing Android apps. See our team awards ceremony photo in the <b>" 2017 HackNTU Introduction"</b> section.
