I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html). In my fourth year, I went on exchange in College of Engineering & Computer Science at [the Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au).

 Currently, I am working as a research assistant on elution profile-based protein complex algorithm at
[Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw) and going to apply for a USA computational biology Ph.D at the end of this year. I am passionate about developing open source bioinformatics tools and designing algorithms. I have developed two [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) R package which are [RNASeqR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918337) and [sangeranalyseR](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.102459).

I also love cycling, hiking, traveling, and developing Unity game etc.
